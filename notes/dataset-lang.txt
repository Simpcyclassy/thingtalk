// proposal 1:

// this dataset-definition language is part of ThingTalk, and lives
// alongside classes, functions and other ThingTalk stuff

/* the keyword "dataset" introduces a dataset block, containing
   pairs of sentences and programs */

// each device has a default dataset block, which is unnamed
dataset default for @com.twitter language "en" {  
  // a list of statements follows, each with one or more #_[utterance] annotation
  
  let table := @com.twitter.my_tweets()
  #_[utterance="my tweets"],
  #_[utterance="tweets from me"];
  
  // (as described in the other file, you can also define stuff with names
  // and use it as shorthand in the rest of the dataset block)
  let table tweets_from_somebody_specific(in req p_author : Entity(tt:username)) :=
    @com.twitter.search(), author == p_author
  #_[utterance="tweets from ${p_author}"];
    
  let stream(in req p_author : Entity(tt:username)) := monitor tweets_from_somebody_specific(p_author=p_author);
  #_[utterance="when ${p_author} tweets"];
  
  // programs too:
  monitor @com.twitter.direct_messages() => @com.twitter.send_direct_message(to=sender)
  #_[utterance="auto reply to twitter dms"];
}

// datasets can also be named
dataset @com.twitter.only_twitter language "en" {
  // for example, this dataset is "only twitter" because it talks about
  // twitter implicitly, so it would be appropriate for a virtual assistant
  // that only deals with twitter
  
  
  // if they are named, they must import the classes they want to use
  import class @com.twitter;
  
  let stream(in req p_author : Entity(tt:username)) := monitor (@com.twitter.search(), author == p_author);
  #_[utterance="when ${p_author} says something"];
}

// you can import datasets one into the other
dataset @org.thingpedia.social_media language "en" {
  // imports occur at the language for the current namespace (you cannot get a multi-language assistant,
  // that would not make a lot of sense)
  
  import dataset default for @com.facebook;
  import dataset @com.twitter.only_twitter;
}

// you can also import everything as a short hand

// this is effectively how you'd declare the current general purpose assistant
dataset @org.thingpedia.everything {
  import class *;
  import dataset default for *;
}
